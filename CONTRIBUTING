# How to contribute

In order to contribute to the development of PT3 please create a Pull Request
with a clear list of what you've done. For major changes, please open an issue
first to discuss what you would like to change.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine
for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
